 ## Intro to DeFi
 This is an introductory course to DeFi

 
 ## Description
 Asset tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset, such as real estate or art, into a digital token on a blockchain. This token can then be bought, sold, and traded on a blockchain-based marketplace, similar to how stocks are traded on a stock exchange. By tokenizing assets, it allows for fractional ownership and increased liquidity, as well as enabling new investment opportunities for investors.

In this course we will study
