 ## DeFi Introduction
 
 **Introduction**        
DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is a new breed of financial applications built on the blockchain that operate autonomously without human intervention. These applications are created by developers who program specific rules for trading, lending, borrowing, and more, which are then deployed on the blockchain for anyone worldwide to access. The "Decentralized" aspect refers to the fact that the blockchain is usually not owned by a single entity but rather maintained by a network of individuals who participate as members, earning rewards in the blockchain's native currency.

In traditional trading, we typically interact with other individuals or trade through exchanges, but DeFi takes a different approach. With DeFi applications, trades are facilitated by smart contracts that execute automatically based on predetermined conditions. Although the outcome of the trade may be subject to interpretation, the important thing is that trades can occur immediately when the conditions are met. This provides sellers with the ability to sell their assets quickly when they need cash, while also benefiting smart contracts that purchase assets at a lower price.

DeFi applications are not limited to trading but extend to all aspects of finance. These applications include autonomous lending and borrowing, insurance, investing in startups, new fundraising methods, community buying of patents, crowdfunding public good projects, and more.
 
 **What is Decentralization?**        
At present, most of our financial institutions operate in a centralized manner, meaning that entities such as banks, insurance companies, and trading platforms are owned by corporations and overseen by governments. The reliability of the financial system is dependent on the stability of these governing bodies.

In centralized systems, decisions regarding matters such as loan approval, policy creation, and long-term planning are made by central entities without providing adequate justification. Transparency is typically lacking in such systems, with crucial information often remaining inaccessible to the public. For example, we may not have access to the balance sheets of the banks where we deposit our life savings, nor do we often know the true financial standing of the insurance companies from which we purchase products like life insurance or annuities, which can have lifespans of over 25 years. This can be likened to communist governments, where individuals have little to no influence in governance.

Decentralized systems at the same time are not owned by any individual or entity. For example many countries have tried to ban bitcoin in their countries, but since governments have no control over it, no government or entity can control it. Following are the properties of decentralized systems

1. Distributed control: the decision-making is spread across a network of nodes or participants, rather than being controlled by a single central authority.
2. Trustlessness: In a decentralized system, trust is achieved through the use of cryptographic algorithms that ensure that transactions are valid and secure, even if the parties involved are unknown or untrusted.
3. Transparency: All transactions and data recorded on a public ledger that can be accessed by anyone. This makes it easier to audit and verify the integrity of the system, and reduces the risk of fraud or corruption.
4. Flexibility: Changes can be made to the system without requiring approval from a central authority. Community votes on the important decisions and the updates are then incorporated in the network.
5. Resilience: There is no single point of failure that can bring the system down. If one node or participant fails, the system can continue to operate without interruption.
 
 **Why Decentralization?**        
The question of why decentralization is necessary is analogous to the debate between democratic and communist forms of government. Despite the potential for greater efficiency and speed in a communist government, most developed countries have opted for a democratic system. 

However, their financial systems remain centralized, with top officials of independent central banks appointed by the elected governments. This often results in short-term goals taking precedence over long-term prospects. Monetary policies are tailored to meet the immediate needs of the ruling party rather than being grounded in empirical data and the real financial state of the world. Inflation and interest rate calculations are sometimes manipulated to present a positive economic outlook, despite being divorced from accurate data.

Decentralization is particularly important in light of the vast sums of money printed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Uncertainty surrounds whether these trillions of dollars were invested in the most effective manner, and the allocation of funds remains ambiguous. Although technology exists that enables the tracking of every dollar's flow, governments may be reluctant to utilize it, as it could expose their poor decision-making. Transparency cannot guarantee the best outcomes, but it can facilitate the identification and elimination of flawed and inefficient systems.

In many developed nations, the majority of banks operate on a fractional reserve system. This means that when we deposit money in our savings accounts, the banks often invest that money without our explicit permission. If a large number of customers attempt to withdraw their savings on the same day, it can trigger a "bank run" and potentially result in the bank going bankrupt. It raises the question: Do you know what investments your bank has made? Should you have the right to know all the details about how your money is being invested, including who is making the decisions and what criteria they are using?
 
 **Decentralized Money**        
In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced as the first mainstream blockchain-based decentralized digital currency. Its network of users verify and record transactions without relying on a central authority or intermediary. Instead of trust, Bitcoin operates based on cryptographic proof. All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making them difficult to fake and hard to reverse. This is achieved through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

To explain how decentralized cryptocurrencies work, let's consider a simple example. Taylor wants to send 1 Bitcoin to Joe. To do so, she needs to have a crypto wallet with at least 1 Bitcoin in it(similar to a bank account). The Bitcoin network tracks all money on a public ledger, so anyone can verify the sources from which Taylor obtained her Bitcoins and the total amount she holds.

Taylor initiates the transfer using her private key, which is like a bank account credential. Someone on the network verifies Taylor's balance and checks that the credentials belong to her, then records the transaction on the public ledger. Taylor's account balance is reduced by 1 Bitcoin, and Joe's is increased by 1 Bitcoin. The member who validates the transaction earns a small fee.

The public ledger is continuously validated using cryptography to prevent fake transactions. When a member validates a new transaction or set of transactions (a block), it is broadcasted to the network, and everyone is updated to the latest network state.
 
 **Smart Contracts**        
Blockchain are not just limited to capturing the simple transactions that involve a single transfer.  Blockchain like Ethereum allow developers to write code which can then be used to encode rules related to when and how the transfer should be done.

Using smart contracts you can write simple programs that do continuous transfer of money every second to a community. You can add conditions, i.e. transfer the money to group1 if certain conditions are met or transfer money to another group every second, if the conditions are not met etc. You also add logic like a transfer can only happen if the majority of the people in the community agree to something or vote “yes” for the transfer.  

Every smart contract when deployed on blockchain, get a wallet address(or an account number) assignment to them. This allows programs to be able to send or receive money. No human is required to mediate these transactions. This has enabled us to write applications that were not possible earlier. 

DeFi refers to the financial applications that are run by smart contracts on top of blockchain with no human as intermediary
