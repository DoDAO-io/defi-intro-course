  "details": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new movement in the world of finance that aims to build decentralized financial applications using blockchain technology. The main idea behind DeFi is to bring financial services to people who are underbanked or unbanked, and to provide transparent, secure and accessible financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries such as banks. This can include lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and more. The goal of DeFi is to provide financial services that are open to everyone, regardless of geography or personal circumstances, and that are not controlled by any single entity.\n\n\nIn this course we will study\n1. Chapter 1 - DeFi Introduction\n2. Chapter 2 - Blockchain Basics\n3. Chapter 3 - Blockchain Tokens\n4. Chapter 4 - Wallets \n5. Chapter 5 - TradFi vs CeFi vs DeFi  \n\n\n",

It operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions take place directly between users without the need for intermediaries. This decentralization is a key feature of Bitcoin and one of the reasons why it was created in the first place. It allows for a more open and transparent financial system, as well as greater resistance to censorship and control by any single entity.\n\nBitcoin was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency and does not have the built-in capability to support complex functionality. At the same time, Ethereum was specifically designed to be a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, and its programming language, Solidity, was created specifically for this purpose.",

Create and use tokens as a store of value\n2. Validate and record transactions related to transferring of tokens or other state update logic\n3. Write simple programs, called smart contracts, to perform some logic and update the state of tokens.\n4. Smart contracts also have an account number (wallet address) associated with them, enabling smart contracts to receive and send money/tokens.\n",

Be able to by stock of any country from anywhere\n\n## Some Advanced Use Cases\n1. When hosting global online events, you aim to maximize participation and involvement. After the event concludes, you plan to compensate contributors based on their level of involvement, using a percentage of the profits.\n2. For hobby projects that have a large user base, you may wish to take it to the next level and commercialize it. In this scenario, you may want to involve your customers as partners, providing them with a flexible investment option that allows them to access their funds at any time.\n3. Your company excels in the production of top-quality basement flood prevention pumps with substantial profit margins. To guarantee customer satisfaction, you offer a warranty that compensates for 50% of damages in the unlikely event the pump fails to perform. To secure funds for the warranty, you are seeking to raise money in exchange for a monthly share of the profits.\n4. Your goal is to invest in startups while retaining the ability to sell your investment at any time, much like stocks.\n5. You aim to distribute revenue from podcasts or YouTube content based on views and topic categories.\n\nThese are only a few of the gaps in the current financial system that need to be addressed. There are countless more frequent use cases that require solutions.",

Once the funds are on the blockchain, they can be easily moved through the use of smart contracts, which allow for the coding of instructions.\n\nThe necessary infrastructure for financial apps, such as the transfer of funds between banks and the apps, executing code, and maintaining the app's uptime, is already in place.

Transactions are verified and recorded through cryptography, making it nearly impossible for any one user to alter the record retroactively without being detected by the network. The result is a system that is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship, and one that allows multiple parties to have a shared and consistent view of a database without requiring a central authority. This makes it particularly useful for applications such as cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, and other applications that require a secure and transparent way of tracking transactions.\n\n",

          "details": "A blockchain ledger works by maintaining a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This creates a chain of blocks, hence the name \"blockchain.\"\n\nWhen a new transaction is initiated, it is broadcast to the network of nodes (computers) that maintain the ledger. These nodes then validate the transaction using algorithms built into the blockchain protocol, such as checking that the sender has enough funds to complete the transaction. Once validated, the transaction is added to a block and the block is added to the blockchain.\n\nEach node in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain, and all nodes must reach consensus on the state of the ledger before any new block can be added. This ensures that the ledger is consistent and tamper-proof, as any attempt to alter a block would require a majority of nodes to agree to the change, which is highly unlikely.\n\nThe decentralized and secure nature of the blockchain ledger makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, including secure record keeping, smart contracts, and digital currencies.\n\n",

          "shortTitle": "Hashing",
          "details": "Hashing is an essential concept in blockchain technology and plays a crucial role in maintaining its security and integrity.\n\nA hash is a mathematical function that takes an input (or \"message\") and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a \"digest\" that is unique to the unique values of the input. In the context of blockchain, hashes are used to represent the data stored in a block, such as transaction data.\n\nWhen a new block is added to the blockchain, the hash of the block is calculated using the hash function. The hash of the previous block is also included in the calculation of the new block's hash. This creates a chain of blocks, each with a unique hash, and a reference to the previous block's hash. As a result, any change to the data in a block will result in a different hash for that block, which would be easily detected.\n\nThis is why hashes are important in blockchain technology. They ensure that once a block has been added to the blockchain, its data cannot be altered without also changing the hashes of all subsequent blocks, which would be noticed by the network and rejected.\n\nIn summary, hashing is a key component of blockchain technology that helps to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the blockchain by creating a chain of hashes that reference each other and can detect any changes to the data.",

          "details": "In a blockchain, money is transferred through a process called a \"transaction.\" A transaction is simply a transfer of value from one person (or address) to another.\n\nHere's how a typical transaction works on a blockchain:\n\n1. The sender creates a new transaction with the details of the recipient (their address), the amount to be transferred, and the sender's private key to sign the transaction.\n2. The transaction is broadcast to the network, where it is verified by nodes (computers) that make up the network.\n3. The verified transaction is then added to a block along with other transactions, and the block is added to the blockchain.\n4. The recipient can now access the funds by using their private key to unlock the transaction.\n\nIn a blockchain network that uses a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, the value being transferred is in the form of digital coins. The transaction updates the balance of the sender and recipient's addresses on the blockchain.\n\nIt's important to note that in a public blockchain network like Bitcoin, transactions are transparent and can be seen by anyone. However, the identity of the individuals behind the addresses remains anonymous, as only the address is recorded on the blockchain.\n\n",
