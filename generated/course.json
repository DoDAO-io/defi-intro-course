  "details": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new movement in the world of finance that aims to build decentralized financial applications using blockchain technology. The main idea behind DeFi is to bring financial services to people who are underbanked or unbanked, and to provide transparent, secure and accessible financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries such as banks. This can include lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and more. The goal of DeFi is to provide financial services that are open to everyone, regardless of geography or personal circumstances, and that are not controlled by any single entity.\n\n\nIn this course we will study\n1. Chapter 1 - DeFi Introduction\n2. Chapter 2 - Blockchain Basics\n3. Chapter 3 - Blockchain Tokens\n4. Chapter 4 - Wallets \n5. Chapter 5 - TradFi vs CeFi vs DeFi  \n\n\n",

          "details": "Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions take place directly between users without the need for intermediaries. This decentralization is a key feature of Bitcoin and one of the reasons why it was created in the first place. It allows for a more open and transparent financial system, as well as greater resistance to censorship and control by any single entity.\n\nBitcoin was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency and does not have the built-in capability to support complex functionality. At the same time, Ethereum was specifically designed to be a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, and its programming language, Solidity, was created specifically for this purpose.",

Create and use tokens as a store of value\n2. Validate and record transactions related to transferring of tokens or other state update logic\n3. Write simple programs, called smart contracts, to perform some logic and update the state of tokens.\n4. Smart contracts also have an account number (wallet address) associated with them, enabling smart contracts to receive and send money/tokens.\n",
