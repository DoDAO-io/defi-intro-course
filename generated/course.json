  "details": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new movement in the world of finance that aims to build decentralized financial applications using blockchain technology. The main idea behind DeFi is to bring financial services to people who are underbanked or unbanked, and to provide transparent, secure and accessible financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries such as banks. This can include lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and more. The goal of DeFi is to provide financial services that are open to everyone, regardless of geography or personal circumstances, and that are not controlled by any single entity.\n\n\nIn this course we will study\n1.

          "details": "DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is a new breed of financial applications built on the blockchain that operate autonomously without human intervention. These applications are created by developers who program specific rules for trading, lending, borrowing, and more, which are then deployed on the blockchain for anyone worldwide to access. The \"Decentralized\" aspect refers to the fact that the blockchain is usually not owned by a single entity but rather maintained by a network of individuals who participate as members, earning rewards in the blockchain's native currency.\n\nIn traditional trading, we typically interact with other individuals or trade through exchanges, but DeFi takes a different approach. With DeFi applications, trades are facilitated by smart contracts that execute automatically based on predetermined conditions. Although the outcome of the trade may be subject to interpretation, the important thing is that trades can occur immediately when the conditions are met. This provides sellers with the ability to sell their assets quickly when they need cash, while also benefiting smart contracts that purchase assets at a lower price.\n\nDeFi applications are not limited to trading but extend to all aspects of finance. These applications include autonomous lending and borrowing, insurance, investing in startups, new fundraising methods, community buying of patents, crowdfunding public good projects, and more.\n",

          "shortTitle": "Decentralization",
          "details": "At present, most of our financial institutions operate in a centralized manner, meaning that entities such as banks, insurance companies, and trading platforms are owned by corporations and overseen by governments. The reliability of the financial system is dependent on the stability of these governing bodies.\n\nIn centralized systems, decisions regarding matters such as loan approval, policy creation, and long-term planning are made by central entities without providing adequate justification. Transparency is typically lacking in such systems, with crucial information often remaining inaccessible to the public. For example, we may not have access to the balance sheets of the banks where we deposit our life savings, nor do we often know the true financial standing of the insurance companies from which we purchase products like life insurance or annuities, which can have lifespans of over 25 years. This can be likened to communist governments, where individuals have little to no influence in governance.\n\nDecentralized systems at the same time are not owned by any individual or entity. For example many countries have tried to ban bitcoin in their countries, but since governments have no control over it, no government or entity can control it. Following are the properties of decentralized systems\n\n1. Distributed control: the decision-making is spread across a network of nodes or participants, rather than being controlled by a single central authority.\n2. Trustlessness: In a decentralized system, trust is achieved through the use of cryptographic algorithms that ensure that transactions are valid and secure, even if the parties involved are unknown or untrusted.\n3. Transparency: All transactions and data recorded on a public ledger that can be accessed by anyone. This makes it easier to audit and verify the integrity of the system, and reduces the risk of fraud or corruption.\n4. Flexibility: Changes can be made to the system without requiring approval from a central authority. Community votes on the important decisions and the updates are then incorporated in the network.\n5. Resilience: There is no single point of failure that can bring the system down. If one node or participant fails, the system can continue to operate without interruption.\n",

          "shortTitle": "Why Decentralization",
          "details": "The question of why decentralization is necessary is analogous to the debate between democratic and communist forms of government. Despite the potential for greater efficiency and speed in a communist government, most developed countries have opted for a democratic system. \n\nHowever, their financial systems remain centralized, with top officials of independent central banks appointed by the elected governments. This often results in short-term goals taking precedence over long-term prospects. Monetary policies are tailored to meet the immediate needs of the ruling party rather than being grounded in empirical data and the real financial state of the world. Inflation and interest rate calculations are sometimes manipulated to present a positive economic outlook, despite being divorced from accurate data.\n\nDecentralization is particularly important in light of the vast sums of money printed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Uncertainty surrounds whether these trillions of dollars were invested in the most effective manner, and the allocation of funds remains ambiguous. Although technology exists that enables the tracking of every dollar's flow, governments may be reluctant to utilize it, as it could expose their poor decision-making. Transparency cannot guarantee the best outcomes, but it can facilitate the identification and elimination of flawed and inefficient systems.\n\nIn many developed nations, the majority of banks operate on a fractional reserve system. This means that when we deposit money in our savings accounts, the banks often invest that money without our explicit permission. If a large number of customers attempt to withdraw their savings on the same day, it can trigger a \"bank run\" and potentially result in the bank going bankrupt. It raises the question: Do you know what investments your bank has made? Should you have the right to know all the details about how your money is being invested, including who is making the decisions and what criteria they are using?\n",

          "details": "In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced as the first mainstream blockchain-based decentralized digital currency. Its network of users verify and record transactions without relying on a central authority or intermediary. Instead of trust, Bitcoin operates based on cryptographic proof. All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making them difficult to fake and hard to reverse. This is achieved through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.\n\nTo explain how decentralized cryptocurrencies work, let's consider a simple example. Taylor wants to send 1 Bitcoin to Joe. To do so, she needs to have a crypto wallet with at least 1 Bitcoin in it(similar to a bank account). The Bitcoin network tracks all money on a public ledger, so anyone can verify the sources from which Taylor obtained her Bitcoins and the total amount she holds.\n\nTaylor initiates the transfer using her private key, which is like a bank account credential. Someone on the network verifies Taylor's balance and checks that the credentials belong to her, then records the transaction on the public ledger. Taylor's account balance is reduced by 1 Bitcoin, and Joe's is increased by 1 Bitcoin. The member who validates the transaction earns a small fee.\n\nThe public ledger is continuously validated using cryptography to prevent fake transactions. When a member validates a new transaction or set of transactions (a block), it is broadcasted to the network, and everyone is updated to the latest network state.\n",

          "details": "Blockchain are not just limited to capturing the simple transactions that involve a single transfer.  Blockchain like Ethereum allow developers to write code which can then be used to encode rules related to when and how the transfer should be done.\n\nUsing smart contracts you can write simple programs that do continuous transfer of money every second to a community. You can add conditions, i.e. transfer the money to group1 if certain conditions are met or transfer money to another group every second, if the conditions are not met etc. You also add logic like a transfer can only happen if the majority of the people in the community agree to something or vote “yes” for the transfer.  \n\nEvery smart contract when deployed on blockchain, get a wallet address(or an account number) assignment to them. This allows programs to be able to send or receive money. No human is required to mediate these transactions. This has enabled us to write applications that were not possible earlier. \n\nDeFi refers to the financial applications that are run by smart contracts on top of blockchain with no human as intermediary\n",

In fact, there are many DeFi projects that offer rewards to developers who can build user-friendly dashboards that provide insights into the system.\n\nEven during a period in 2022 when cryptocurrency prices plummeted by 95%, the top DeFi projects continued to behave as expected. In contrast, centralized crypto exchanges, similar to traditional banks, do not share data and do not offer insurance. Many centralized exchanges suffered financial losses and went bankrupt in 2022, while pure DeFi exchanges fared relatively well.\n\nExample [https://dune.com/browse/dashboards](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) is a link to dashboards created by the DeFi community about different projects.

Like in a group of artists that post content on social media, we want to divide the payments based on number of views, quality, or category. Creating these types of applications are very hard in traditional finance.   \n\nDeFi is not just limited to purely finance. It enables the creation of communities that are backed by a common currency. The more business the community can create, the more it benefits each member of the community. There are many projects in crypto world that operate purely on \n\n1. Nouns(https://nouns.wtf) -    The Nouns project is a distinctive undertaking that employs blockchain technology and was launched on August 8, 2021. Nouns NFTs are pixelated representations of a person, place, or thing, and one new Noun is created and auctioned every 24 hours using a trustless system. The entire auction proceeds of each Noun are automatically transferred to the treasury.\n\n    Every owner of a Noun becomes a member of the Nouns DAO and is entitled to one vote in all matters of governance. Noun votes are non-transferable, but can be delegated to another individual as long as the owner still possesses the Noun. Nouns exclusively control the treasury through governance. The group of ten builders who initiated the project are called 'Nounders' and will receive rewards in the form of Nouns, which amounts to 10% of the supply for the first 5 years.\n\n\n2. Constitution DAO - Constitution DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, raised nearly $47 million in Ether within five days through a social media crowdfunding campaign in mid-November 2021. The group's goal was to use the funds to purchase a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution at a Sotheby's auction and donate it to a non-profit run by DAO donors. Although they were unsuccessful in their bid, their efforts demonstrated the influence of decentralized finance-powered communities. The incident also highlighted an interesting historical parallel of ordinary individuals uniting to challenge a conventional establishment.\n"

By identifying and addressing a problem that resonates with an existing audience, founders can develop a working product for less than a thousand dollars. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have accelerated the pace of development by eliminating the need for founders to worry about acquiring a computer server for website deployment. These providers make it easy to provision computers as needed, thereby increasing productivity and reducing costs.\n\nSimilarly, financial applications built on blockchains are also experiencing a similar ease in development. Developers no longer need to worry about integrating with banks, managing transactions, or deploying code. All of these issues are resolved by blockchains, allowing developers to focus solely on the core logic of their applications.\n\nFor instance, Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) initially designed for efficient stablecoin trading, has over $5 billion locked in it and a development team of only five members. Most DeFi platforms with hundreds of millions of dollars traded or locked on them have team sizes of less than ten developers.\n",

While this creates a competitive environment, it benefits users as it helps to keep fees minimal, which is important as users may switch to similar platforms that offer cheaper fees.\n\nIn addition, each deployed contract has a unique blockchain address, allowing anyone to call these smart contracts by providing the right parameters. Many applications are built on top of smart contracts developed by other applications, resulting in a win-win situation for everyone.\n\nOne such example is Fjord Foundry, which uses smart contracts developed by Balancer, a project that connects inspired projects with passionate supporters using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs). Fjord Foundry agreed to the terms that activate a 2% platform access fee through Fjord Foundry, split equally between the Balancer DAO and Fjord Foundry.\n\nThe level of innovation in DeFi as a result of this open and collaborative environment is far greater than what occurs in Traditional Finance over a decade.\n",

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This creates a chain of blocks, hence the name \"blockchain.\"\n\nWhen a new transaction is initiated, it is broadcast to the network of nodes (computers) that maintain the ledger. These nodes then validate the transaction using algorithms built into the blockchain protocol, such as checking that the sender has enough funds to complete the transaction. Once validated, the transaction is added to a block and the block is added to the blockchain.\n\nEach node in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain, and all nodes must reach consensus on the state of the ledger before any new block can be added. This ensures that the ledger is consistent and tamper-proof, as any attempt to alter a block would require a majority of nodes to agree to the change, which is highly unlikely.\n\nThe decentralized and secure nature of the blockchain ledger makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, including secure record keeping, smart contracts, and digital currencies.\n\n",

          "details": "Hashing is an essential concept in blockchain technology and plays a crucial role in maintaining its security and integrity.\n\nA hash is a mathematical function that takes an input (or \"message\") and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a \"digest\" that is unique to the unique values of the input. In the context of blockchain, hashes are used to represent the data stored in a block, such as transaction data.\n\nWhen a new block is added to the blockchain, the hash of the block is calculated using the hash function. The hash of the previous block is also included in the calculation of the new block's hash. This creates a chain of blocks, each with a unique hash, and a reference to the previous block's hash. As a result, any change to the data in a block will result in a different hash for that block, which would be easily detected.\n\nThis is why hashes are important in blockchain technology. They ensure that once a block has been added to the blockchain, its data cannot be altered without also changing the hashes of all subsequent blocks, which would be noticed by the network and rejected.\n\nIn summary, hashing is a key component of blockchain technology that helps to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the blockchain by creating a chain of hashes that reference each other and can detect any changes to the data.",

          "details": "In a blockchain, money is transferred through a process called a \"transaction.\" A transaction is simply a transfer of value from one person (or address) to another.\n\nHere's how a typical transaction works on a blockchain:\n\n1. The sender creates a new transaction with the details of the recipient (their address), the amount to be transferred, and the sender's private key to sign the transaction.\n2. The transaction is broadcast to the network, where it is verified by nodes (computers) that make up the network.\n3. The verified transaction is then added to a block along with other transactions, and the block is added to the blockchain.\n4. The recipient can now access the funds by using their private key to unlock the transaction.\n\nIn a blockchain network that uses a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, the value being transferred is in the form of digital coins. The transaction updates the balance of the sender and recipient's addresses on the blockchain.\n\nIt's important to note that in a public blockchain network like Bitcoin, transactions are transparent and can be seen by anyone. However, the identity of the individuals behind the addresses remains anonymous, as only the address is recorded on the blockchain.\n\n",

Utility Tokens: Utility tokens are used to access specific services or products within a decentralized application (dapp) built on the Ethereum network. The tokens give holders access to the services or products offered by the dapp.\n4. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications: ERC-20 tokens play a central role in the rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem, serving as the building blocks for many decentralized financial applications, such as lending and borrowing platforms, trading platforms, and more.\n5. Gaming: ERC-20 tokens can be used as virtual currency within decentralized games, providing a secure and decentralized way to trade and exchange virtual goods and items.",

          "details": "There are several types of ERC tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem, each serving a different purpose. Here are some of the most common ERC token types:\n\n1. ERC-20: As mentioned before, ERC-20 is the most widely adopted standard for Ethereum tokens. It defines a set of rules and guidelines for Ethereum tokens to follow, making it easier for developers to create and deploy new tokens on the Ethereum network.\n2. ERC-721: ERC-721 is a non-fungible token (NFT) standard, which means that each token is unique and cannot be replaced or divided into smaller units. ERC-721 tokens are commonly used for collectibles, such as virtual art and other digital assets.\n3. ERC-1155: ERC-1155 is a multi-token standard that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. This makes it more efficient and cost-effective for developers to create and manage multiple types of tokens.\n4. ERC-223: ERC-223 is an improvement on the ERC-20 standard, designed to address some of the inefficiencies and security concerns with the transfer of ERC-20 tokens. ERC-223 tokens offer improved security and efficiency compared to ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThere are several different types of ERC tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem, each serving a different purpose and offering different functionality. The choice of ERC token type depends on the specific use case and requirements of the project.",

          "details": "### Custodian Wallets\nCustodian and non-custodian wallets are two types of cryptocurrency wallets that differ in the way they manage the private keys of users.\n\nCustodian wallets are cryptocurrency wallets where the private keys are managed by a third-party, usually a cryptocurrency exchange or financial services company. This means that the company has control over the user's funds and is responsible for securing them. Examples of custodian wallets include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.\n\n### Non Custodian Wallets\nNon-custodian wallets are cryptocurrency wallets where the user holds their own private keys. This means that the user has full control over their funds and is responsible for securing their own private keys. Examples of non-custodian wallets include hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger, and software wallets like MetaMask and TrustWallet.\n\n\n### Difference\nThe main difference between the two is control over the private keys and security. With a custodian wallet, the user is relying on the security measures put in place by the third-party to protect their funds, while with a non-custodian wallet, the user has full control and responsibility over the security of their funds.\n\n### Not your keys not your coins\n\"Not your keys, not your coins\" is a common phrase used in the cryptocurrency community to emphasize the importance of having control over your own private keys.\n\nThe phrase \"not your keys, not your coins\" is a reminder that if you do not have control over your private keys, you do not have full control over your cryptocurrency assets. This is because someone else, such as a malicious actor or a hacked exchange, could gain access to your funds and steal them.\n\nTherefore, it is important for individuals who own cryptocurrencies to take steps to secure their private keys and to avoid leaving their assets on centralized exchanges for long periods of time. Instead, they can store their private keys on a secure hardware wallet or use a non-custodial software wallet to have greater control over their assets."

They act as intermediaries between traditional banks and enable users to purchase and store digital currencies. However, it's crucial to remember that these centralized exchanges retain control over the private keys of their users' accounts. Sadly, many of these exchanges went bankrupt in 2022, resulting in the loss of funds for their users.\n\n\n### Advantages of centralized exchanges include:\n\n- User-friendly interface: CEXs often have user-friendly interfaces that are easy to use and understand, making them accessible to a wide range of users.\n- High liquidity: CEXs typically have high liquidity, meaning that users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly and easily.\n- Wide range of cryptocurrencies: CEXs often offer a wide range of cryptocurrencies, making it easy for users to find the assets they are looking for.\n- Customer support: CEXs often have dedicated customer support teams that are available to help users with any issues or questions they may have.\n\n### Disadvantages of centralized exchanges include:\n- Security risks: Centralized exchanges are vulnerable to hacking and other security threats, which can result in the loss of users' assets.\n- Single point of failure: Since CEXs are controlled by a single entity, they represent a single point of failure, meaning that if the exchange fails, users may lose access to their assets.\n- Lack of control: Users do not have direct control over their assets when they are stored on a centralized exchange, as they are stored on the exchange's servers.\n- Privacy concerns: CEXs often require users to provide personal information, which can be vulnerable to misuse or theft."
