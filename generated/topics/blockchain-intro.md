## Blockchain Intro
 
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The decentralized nature of the technology ensures that no single party has control over the data and makes it resistant to tampering and revision, making it a secure way of storing and transmitting information. This technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but has potential applications in a variety of industries, including finance, supply chain management, and voting systems.
