- CeFi - Centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the cryptocurrency world operate on the premise that all crypto trading transactions are managed and executed through a central platform in the realm of centralized finance. Notable examples of centralized finance companies include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
