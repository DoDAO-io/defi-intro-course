##### What is a significant drawback of centralized financial systems?  

- [ ]  They are highly transparent
- [x]  They often lack transparency
- [ ]  They are highly flexible
- [ ]  They have no single point of failure
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: In centralized financial systems, transparency is typically lacking, with crucial information often remaining inaccessible to the public.

##### What are the key properties of decentralized systems?  

- [ ]  Centralized control, trust-based, opaque, rigid, and vulnerable
- [ ]  Centralized control, trustless, transparent, flexible, and resilient
- [x]  Distributed control, trustlessness, transparency, flexibility, and resilience
- [ ]  Distributed control, trust-based, opaque, rigid, and vulnerable
  
Hint: NoHint

##### How is trust achieved in a decentralized system?  

- [ ]  Through centralized authorities verifying transactions
- [x]  Through cryptographic algorithms that ensure transactions are valid and secure
- [ ]  By relying on the reputation of participants in the network
- [ ]  Through a single point of control and validation
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: In a decentralized system, trust is achieved through the use of cryptographic algorithms that ensure that transactions are valid and secure, even if the parties involved are unknown or untrusted.

##### Why do many developed countries prefer democratic systems over communist systems?  

- [x]  Democratic systems offer more freedom, individual rights, and transparency
- [ ]  Democratic systems are always more efficient and faster
- [ ]  Democratic systems have no drawbacks
- [ ]  Communist systems lack economic stability
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Developed countries prefer democratic systems because, despite the potential for greater efficiency and speed in a communist government, democratic systems offer more freedom, individual rights, and transparency.

##### What is one reason why decentralization is important in financial systems?  

- [ ]  It guarantees the best economic outcomes
- [x]  It promotes transparency, facilitating the identification and elimination of flawed and inefficient systems
- [ ]  It ensures that all participants have equal control and influence
- [ ]  It prevents any form of corruption or fraud
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Decentralization is important in financial systems because it promotes transparency, which can facilitate the identification and elimination of flawed and inefficient systems.

##### What is a potential issue with banks operating on a fractional reserve system?  

- [ ]  Banks always invest the deposited money wisely
- [ ]  Banks can never go bankrupt
- [x]  It can trigger a "bank run" and potentially result in the bank going bankrupt
- [ ]  Customers have full control over their deposited money
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: A potential issue with banks operating on a fractional reserve system is that it can trigger a "bank run" if a large number of customers attempt to withdraw their savings on the same day, potentially resulting in the bank going bankrupt.

##### What mechanism does Bitcoin use to achieve consensus and validate transactions?  

- [x]  Proof-of-work consensus mechanism
- [ ]  Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism
- [ ]  Delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism
- [ ]  Federated Byzantine Agreement
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to achieve consensus and validate transactions on its network.

##### What is a smart contract and what kind of blockchain allows for their use?  

- [ ]  A smart contract is a legal agreement between two parties, and Bitcoin allows for their use
- [x]  A smart contract is a self-executing contract encoded in code, and Ethereum allows for their use
- [ ]  A smart contract is a digital signature, and Ripple allows for their use
- [ ]  A smart contract is a digital currency, and Cardano allows for their use
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Ethereum is a blockchain that allows for the use of smart contracts.
