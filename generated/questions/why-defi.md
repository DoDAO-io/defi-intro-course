##### What is the main principle behind the phrase "don't trust, verify" in the world of cryptocurrency?  

- [x]  Relying on public data and transparency instead of trust in centralized authorities
- [ ]  Trusting all parties in a transaction without verifying their information
- [ ]  Trusting only verified institutions for transactions
- [ ]  Verifying only the most recent transactions in a blockchain
  
Hint: Nohint
         
Explanation: The main principle behind the phrase "don't trust, verify" in the world of cryptocurrency is that the public blockchain allows anyone to access and query the data for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, rather than relying on trust in a centralized authority like traditional finance.

##### Which aspect of DeFi projects helped them fare relatively well compared to centralized exchanges during the 2022 cryptocurrency price plummet?  

- [ ]  Lower transaction fees
- [x]  Transparency and data availability on the public blockchain
- [ ]  Higher liquidity
- [ ]  Faster transaction processing times
  
Hint: Nohint
         
Explanation: DeFi projects fared relatively well during the 2022 cryptocurrency price plummet due to their transparent nature and the availability of information on the public blockchain, which ensured that they continued to behave as expected. Centralized exchanges, on the other hand, suffered losses and bankruptcy due to their lack of transparency and data sharing.

##### What is a unique aspect of the Nouns project in the crypto world?  

- [ ]  It is the first decentralized exchange for NFTs
- [ ]  It is a platform for artists to collaborate and receive payment based on views and quality
- [x]  It creates and auctions one new Noun NFT every 24 hours and grants owners DAO membership
  
Hint: Nohint
         
Explanation: A unique aspect of the Nouns project in the crypto world is that it creates and auctions one new Noun NFT, a pixelated representation of a person, place, or thing, every 24 hours using a trustless system. The entire auction proceeds of each Noun are automatically transferred to the treasury, and every owner of a Noun becomes a member of the Nouns DAO, entitled to one vote in governance matters.
