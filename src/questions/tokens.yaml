  content: What is the purpose of the ERC-20 standard?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    The ERC-20 standard defines a common set of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow, allowing developers to easily create and deploy new tokens on the Ethereum network. It ensures compatibility between tokens and makes it easier for developers to build applications that can interact with multiple types of tokens.
