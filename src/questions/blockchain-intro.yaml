  content: How does a blockchain ensure its ledger is consistent and tamper-proof?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    A blockchain ensures its ledger is consistent and tamper-proof by requiring all nodes to reach consensus on the state of the ledger before any new block can be added. This makes it highly unlikely for any attempt to alter a block to succeed, as it would require a majority of nodes to agree to the change.
