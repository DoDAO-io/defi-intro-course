    Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. It operates on a
    peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions take place directly between
    users without the need for intermediaries. This decentralization is a key
    feature of Bitcoin and one of the reasons why it was created in the first
    place. It allows for a more open and transparent financial system, as well
    as greater resistance to censorship and control by any single entity.


    Bitcoin was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency and does
    not have the built-in capability to support complex functionality. At the
    same time, Ethereum was specifically designed to be a platform for
    decentralized applications and smart contracts, and its programming
    language, Solidity, was created specifically for this purpose.

  shortTitle: What is Blockchain?
  details: >
    Blockchain provides the infrastructure for simple but innovative
    applications related to payments, incentives, investments, etc.


    Blockchains provide the infrastructure for projects to

    1. Create and use tokens as a store of value

    2. Validate and record transactions related to transferring of tokens or
    other state update logic

    3. Write simple programs, called smart contracts, to perform some logic and
    update the state of tokens.

    4. Smart contracts also have an account number (wallet address) associated
    with them, enabling smart contracts to receive and send money/tokens.

    The following are examples of real-world requirements that are not fully met
    by the current financial system:


    ## Some Simple Use Cases

    1. Transfer money to anyone across the world within seconds

    2. Tokenize and trade real world assets like Real Estate.

    3. Fractional ownership of stocks

    4. Be able to by stock of any country from anywhere


    ## Some Advanced Use Cases

    1. When hosting global online events, you aim to maximize participation and
    involvement. After the event concludes, you plan to compensate contributors
    based on their level of involvement, using a percentage of the profits.

    2. For hobby projects that have a large user base, you may wish to take it
    to the next level and commercialize it. In this scenario, you may want to
    involve your customers as partners, providing them with a flexible
    investment option that allows them to access their funds at any time.

    3. Your company excels in the production of top-quality basement flood
    prevention pumps with substantial profit margins. To guarantee customer
    satisfaction, you offer a warranty that compensates for 50% of damages in
    the unlikely event the pump fails to perform. To secure funds for the
    warranty, you are seeking to raise money in exchange for a monthly share of
    the profits.

    4. Your goal is to invest in startups while retaining the ability to sell
    your investment at any time, much like stocks.

    5. You aim to distribute revenue from podcasts or YouTube content based on
    views and topic categories.


    These are only a few of the gaps in the current financial system that need
    to be addressed. There are countless more frequent use cases that require
    solutions.
