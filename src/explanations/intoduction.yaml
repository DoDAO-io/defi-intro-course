    DeFi, short for decentralized finance, refers to financial services on
    public blockchains, mainly Ethereum, providing options to earn interest,
    borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives and assets without the need
    for intermediaries or paperwork. As a global, peer-to-peer, and pseudonymous
    system, DeFi is accessible to everyone and operates at a faster pace
    compared to traditional banking.


    DeFi builds on Bitcoin's basic idea of digital currency, offering a complete
    digital replacement for Wall Street, with lower associated costs. This
    approach can potentially create more accessible, open, free, and fair
    financial markets available to anyone with internet access.



    ### Benefits Of DeFi

    - You can access DeFi by creating a wallet without applying for anything or
    opening an account. 

    - You don't need to provide personal information since it's pseudonymous. 

    - DeFi offers flexibility as you can move your assets quickly without
    waiting for long transfers or paying high fees. 

    - Interest rates and rewards update rapidly, often every 15 seconds, and can
    be significantly higher than traditional Wall Street. 

    - DeFi is transparent, and everyone can see the complete set of
    transactions, which is a level of transparency that private corporations
    rarely grant.

    The following are examples of real-world requirements that are not fully met
    by the current financial system:


    ## Some Simple Use Cases

    1. Transfer money to anyone across the world within seconds

    2. Tokenize and trade real world assets like Real Estate.

    3. Fractional ownership of stocks

    4. Be able to by stock of any country from anywhere


    ## Some Advanced Use Cases

    1. When hosting global online events, you aim to maximize participation and
    involvement. After the event concludes, you plan to compensate contributors
    based on their level of involvement, using a percentage of the profits.

    2. For hobby projects that have a large user base, you may wish to take it
    to the next level and commercialize it. In this scenario, you may want to
    involve your customers as partners, providing them with a flexible
    investment option that allows them to access their funds at any time.

    3. Your company excels in the production of top-quality basement flood
    prevention pumps with substantial profit margins. To guarantee customer
    satisfaction, you offer a warranty that compensates for 50% of damages in
    the unlikely event the pump fails to perform. To secure funds for the
    warranty, you are seeking to raise money in exchange for a monthly share of
    the profits.

    4. Your goal is to invest in startups while retaining the ability to sell
    your investment at any time, much like stocks.

    5. You aim to distribute revenue from podcasts or YouTube content based on
    views and topic categories.


    These are only a few of the gaps in the current financial system that need
    to be addressed. There are countless more frequent use cases that require
    solutions.

    Incorporating the new modern types of financial features into traditional
    banks can take months, whereas they can be implemented on blockchain in just
    a matter of days.


    There are numerous providers that facilitate the transfer of funds from fiat
    or banks to the blockchain and vice versa. Once the funds are on the
    blockchain, they can be easily moved through the use of smart contracts,
    which allow for the coding of instructions.


    The necessary infrastructure for financial apps, such as the transfer of
    funds between banks and the apps, executing code, and maintaining the app's
    uptime, is already in place. This simplifies the process for developers,
    enabling them to concentrate solely on the core functionality of their
    applications.

    An advantage of blockchain for end-users is that the code of smart contracts
    is visible to everyone, regardless of whether the developers or projects
    choose to make it open-source. This leads to a high degree of innovation by
    allowing different projects to draw inspiration from one another.


    Moreover, deployed smart contracts can be invoked by anyone, enabling the
    reuse of code and functionality. This means that developers can utilize
    existing primitive smart contracts related to lending and borrowing, asset
    exchange (liquidity pools), bonding curves, staking, etc. and develop more
    advanced functionality.


    This fosters a highly competitive environment for blockchain projects, but
    ultimately benefits users the most.

    The advent of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of
    financial applications that are not dominated by centralized organizations
    or government control. This is because DeFi transactions are executed and
    managed by code and are publicly visible on the blockchain, leading to a
    more secure and transparent financial system. DeFi is a global financial
    network that is available to all.


    Despite instances of people losing money in blockchain exchanges over the
    past couple of years, it is crucial to recognize that these exchanges may
    have utilized blockchain technology, but they were not decentralized and
    lacked transparency over funds and transactions.


    In the following chapters, we will delve into a comparison between
    Decentralized Finance, Traditional Finance, and Centralized Finance, thereby
    providing a clearer understanding.


  title: Conclusion
- key: introduction
  shortTitle: Introduction
  details: >
    DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is a new breed of financial
    applications built on the blockchain that operate autonomously without human
    intervention. These applications are created by developers who program
    specific rules for trading, lending, borrowing, and more, which are then
    deployed on the blockchain for anyone worldwide to access. The
    "Decentralized" aspect refers to the fact that the blockchain is usually not
    owned by a single entity but rather maintained by a network of individuals
    who participate as members, earning rewards in the blockchain's native
    currency.


    In traditional trading, we typically interact with other individuals or
    trade through exchanges, but DeFi takes a different approach. With DeFi
    applications, trades are facilitated by smart contracts that execute
    automatically based on predetermined conditions. Although the outcome of the
    trade may be subject to interpretation, the important thing is that trades
    can occur immediately when the conditions are met. This provides sellers
    with the ability to sell their assets quickly when they need cash, while
    also benefiting smart contracts that purchase assets at a lower price.


    DeFi applications are not limited to trading but extend to all aspects of
    finance. These applications include autonomous lending and borrowing,
    insurance, investing in startups, new fundraising methods, community buying
    of patents, crowdfunding public good projects, and more.
  title: Introduction
- key: what-is-decentralization
  shortTitle: Decentralization
  details: >
    At present, most of our financial institutions operate in a centralized
    manner, meaning that entities such as banks, insurance companies, and
    trading platforms are owned by corporations and overseen by governments. The
    reliability of the financial system is dependent on the stability of these
    governing bodies.


    In centralized systems, decisions regarding matters such as loan approval,
    policy creation, and long-term planning are made by central entities without
    providing adequate justification. Transparency is typically lacking in such
    systems, with crucial information often remaining inaccessible to the
    public. For example, we may not have access to the balance sheets of the
    banks where we deposit our life savings, nor do we often know the true
    financial standing of the insurance companies from which we purchase
    products like life insurance or annuities, which can have lifespans of over
    25 years. This can be likened to communist governments, where individuals
    have little to no influence in governance.


    Decentralized systems at the same time are not owned by any individual or
    entity. For example many countries have tried to ban bitcoin in their
    countries, but since governments have no control over it, no government or
    entity can control it. Following are the properties of decentralized systems


    1. Distributed control: the decision-making is spread across a network of
    nodes or participants, rather than being controlled by a single central
    authority.

    2. Trustlessness: In a decentralized system, trust is achieved through the
    use of cryptographic algorithms that ensure that transactions are valid and
    secure, even if the parties involved are unknown or untrusted.

    3. Transparency: All transactions and data recorded on a public ledger that
    can be accessed by anyone. This makes it easier to audit and verify the
    integrity of the system, and reduces the risk of fraud or corruption.

    4. Flexibility: Changes can be made to the system without requiring approval
    from a central authority. Community votes on the important decisions and the
    updates are then incorporated in the network.

    5. Resilience: There is no single point of failure that can bring the system
    down. If one node or participant fails, the system can continue to operate
    without interruption.
  title: What is Decentralization?
- key: why-decentralization
  shortTitle: Why Decentralization
  details: >
    The question of why decentralization is necessary is analogous to the debate
    between democratic and communist forms of government. Despite the potential
    for greater efficiency and speed in a communist government, most developed
    countries have opted for a democratic system. 


    However, their financial systems remain centralized, with top officials of
    independent central banks appointed by the elected governments. This often
    results in short-term goals taking precedence over long-term prospects.
    Monetary policies are tailored to meet the immediate needs of the ruling
    party rather than being grounded in empirical data and the real financial
    state of the world. Inflation and interest rate calculations are sometimes
    manipulated to present a positive economic outlook, despite being divorced
    from accurate data.


    Decentralization is particularly important in light of the vast sums of
    money printed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Uncertainty surrounds whether
    these trillions of dollars were invested in the most effective manner, and
    the allocation of funds remains ambiguous. Although technology exists that
    enables the tracking of every dollar's flow, governments may be reluctant to
    utilize it, as it could expose their poor decision-making. Transparency
    cannot guarantee the best outcomes, but it can facilitate the identification
    and elimination of flawed and inefficient systems.


    In many developed nations, the majority of banks operate on a fractional
    reserve system. This means that when we deposit money in our savings
    accounts, the banks often invest that money without our explicit permission.
    If a large number of customers attempt to withdraw their savings on the same
    day, it can trigger a "bank run" and potentially result in the bank going
    bankrupt. It raises the question: Do you know what investments your bank has
    made? Should you have the right to know all the details about how your money
    is being invested, including who is making the decisions and what criteria
    they are using?
  title: Why Decentralization?

  shortTitle: Decentralized Money
  details: >
    In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced as the first mainstream blockchain-based
    decentralized digital currency. Its network of users verify and record
    transactions without relying on a central authority or intermediary. Instead
    of trust, Bitcoin operates based on cryptographic proof. All transactions
    are recorded on a public ledger, making them difficult to fake and hard to
    reverse. This is achieved through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.


    To explain how decentralized cryptocurrencies work, let's consider a simple
    example. Taylor wants to send 1 Bitcoin to Joe. To do so, she needs to have
    a crypto wallet with at least 1 Bitcoin in it(similar to a bank account).
    The Bitcoin network tracks all money on a public ledger, so anyone can
    verify the sources from which Taylor obtained her Bitcoins and the total
    amount she holds.


    Taylor initiates the transfer using her private key, which is like a bank
    account credential. Someone on the network verifies Taylor's balance and
    checks that the credentials belong to her, then records the transaction on
    the public ledger. Taylor's account balance is reduced by 1 Bitcoin, and
    Joe's is increased by 1 Bitcoin. The member who validates the transaction
    earns a small fee.


    The public ledger is continuously validated using cryptography to prevent
    fake transactions. When a member validates a new transaction or set of
    transactions (a block), it is broadcasted to the network, and everyone is
    updated to the latest network state.

    Blockchain are not just limited to capturing the simple transactions that
    involve a single transfer.  Blockchain like Ethereum allow developers to
    write code which can then be used to encode rules related to when and how
    the transfer should be done.


    Using smart contracts you can write simple programs that do continuous
    transfer of money every second to a community. You can add conditions, i.e.
    transfer the money to group1 if certain conditions are met or transfer money
    to another group every second, if the conditions are not met etc. You also
    add logic like a transfer can only happen if the majority of the people in
    the community agree to something or vote “yes” for the transfer.  


    Every smart contract when deployed on blockchain, get a wallet address(or an
    account number) assignment to them. This allows programs to be able to send
    or receive money. No human is required to mediate these transactions. This
    has enabled us to write applications that were not possible earlier. 


    DeFi refers to the financial applications that are run by smart contracts on
    top of blockchain with no human as intermediary
