  details: >-
    Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. It operates on a
    peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions take place directly between
    users without the need for intermediaries. This decentralization is a key
    feature of Bitcoin and one of the reasons why it was created in the first
    place. It allows for a more open and transparent financial system, as well
    as greater resistance to censorship and control by any single entity.


    Bitcoin was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency and does
    not have the built-in capability to support complex functionality. At the
    same time, Ethereum was specifically designed to be a platform for
    decentralized applications and smart contracts, and its programming
    language, Solidity, was created specifically for this purpose.
