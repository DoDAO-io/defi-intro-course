    Important pillars of a good society include 

    1. Stable Government

    2. Good Healthcare

    3. Strong Financial Infrastructure

    4. Great Education



    We take Financial Infrastructure for granted, but every years there are many
    countries, that face hyper inflation, we see governments interference in
    free markets, excessive money printing, citizens pay the cost of
    bankruptcies of big companies etc, no transparency etc. 


    Despite technological advancements, banks and their product offerings have
    not significantly changed.


    1. Real-time knowledge of a country's currency availability is not readily
    available, but is necessary.

    2. Transferring money across borders still remains time-consuming

    3. Monetary policy changes often prioritize short-term government goals over
    long-term national success, leading to high levels of debt.

    4. Governments tend to protect large entities using taxes paid by average
    citizens.

    Bitcoin was released as a decentralized digital currency in 2009 by an
    individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto."
    The primary motivation behind its creation was to provide an alternative to
    traditional centralized financial systems and offer a secure, transparent,
    and censorship-resistant means of conducting transactions and storing value.



    Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. It operates on a
    peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions take place directly between
    users without the need for intermediaries. 



    Bitcoin was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency and does
    not have the built-in capability to support complex functionality. At the
    same time, Ethereum was specifically designed to be a platform for
    decentralized applications and smart contracts, and its programming
    language, Solidity, was created specifically for this purpose.

    Blockchain provides the infrastructure for simple but innovative
    applications related to payments, incentives, investments, etc.


    Blockchains provide the infrastructure for projects to

    1. Create and use tokens as a store of value

    2. Validate and record transactions related to transferring of tokens or
    other state update logic

    3. Write simple programs, called smart contracts, to perform some logic and
    update the state of tokens.

    4. Smart contracts also have an account number (wallet address) associated
    with them, enabling smart contracts to receive and send money/tokens.

    DeFi, short for decentralized finance, refers to financial services on
    public blockchains, mainly Ethereum, providing options to earn interest,
    borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives and assets without the need
    for intermediaries or paperwork. As a global, peer-to-peer, and pseudonymous
    system, DeFi is accessible to everyone and operates at a faster pace
    compared to traditional banking.


    DeFi builds on Bitcoin's basic idea of digital currency, offering a complete
    digital replacement for Wall Street, with lower associated costs. This
    approach can potentially create more accessible, open, free, and fair
    financial markets available to anyone with internet access.



    ### Benefits Of DeFi

    The following are examples of real-world requirements that are not fully met
    by the current financial system:


    ## Some Simple Use Cases

    1. Transfer money to anyone across the world within seconds

    2. Tokenize and trade real world assets like Real Estate.

    3. Fractional ownership of stocks

    4. Be able to by stock of any country from anywhere


    ## Some Advanced Use Cases

    1. When hosting global online events, you aim to maximize participation and
    involvement. After the event concludes, you plan to compensate contributors
    based on their level of involvement, using a percentage of the profits.

    2. For hobby projects that have a large user base, you may wish to take it
    to the next level and commercialize it. In this scenario, you may want to
    involve your customers as partners, providing them with a flexible
    investment option that allows them to access their funds at any time.

    3. Your company excels in the production of top-quality basement flood
    prevention pumps with substantial profit margins. To guarantee customer
    satisfaction, you offer a warranty that compensates for 50% of damages in
    the unlikely event the pump fails to perform. To secure funds for the
    warranty, you are seeking to raise money in exchange for a monthly share of
    the profits.

    4. Your goal is to invest in startups while retaining the ability to sell
    your investment at any time, much like stocks.

    5. You aim to distribute revenue from podcasts or YouTube content based on
    views and topic categories.


    These are only a few of the gaps in the current financial system that need
    to be addressed. There are countless more frequent use cases that require
    solutions.

    Incorporating the new modern types of financial features into traditional
    banks can take months, whereas they can be implemented on blockchain in just
    a matter of days.


    There are numerous providers that facilitate the transfer of funds from fiat
    or banks to the blockchain and vice versa. Once the funds are on the
    blockchain, they can be easily moved through the use of smart contracts,
    which allow for the coding of instructions.


    The necessary infrastructure for financial apps, such as the transfer of
    funds between banks and the apps, executing code, and maintaining the app's
    uptime, is already in place. This simplifies the process for developers,
    enabling them to concentrate solely on the core functionality of their
    applications.

    An advantage of blockchain for end-users is that the code of smart contracts
    is visible to everyone, regardless of whether the developers or projects
    choose to make it open-source. This leads to a high degree of innovation by
    allowing different projects to draw inspiration from one another.


    Moreover, deployed smart contracts can be invoked by anyone, enabling the
    reuse of code and functionality. This means that developers can utilize
    existing primitive smart contracts related to lending and borrowing, asset
    exchange (liquidity pools), bonding curves, staking, etc. and develop more
    advanced functionality.


    This fosters a highly competitive environment for blockchain projects, but
    ultimately benefits users the most.

    The advent of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of
    financial applications that are not dominated by centralized organizations
    or government control. This is because DeFi transactions are executed and
    managed by code and are publicly visible on the blockchain, leading to a
    more secure and transparent financial system. DeFi is a global financial
    network that is available to all.


    Despite instances of people losing money in blockchain exchanges over the
    past couple of years, it is crucial to recognize that these exchanges may
    have utilized blockchain technology, but they were not decentralized and
    lacked transparency over funds and transactions.


    In the following chapters, we will delve into a comparison between
    Decentralized Finance, Traditional Finance, and Centralized Finance, thereby
    providing a clearer understanding.
