  details: >-
    Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. It operates on a
    peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions take place directly between
    users without the need for intermediaries. This decentralization is a key
    feature of Bitcoin and one of the reasons why it was created in the first
    place. It allows for a more open and transparent financial system, as well
    as greater resistance to censorship and control by any single entity.


    Bitcoin was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency and does
    not have the built-in capability to support complex functionality. At the
    same time, Ethereum was specifically designed to be a platform for
    decentralized applications and smart contracts, and its programming
    language, Solidity, was created specifically for this purpose.

  shortTitle: What is Blockchain?
  details: >
    Blockchain provides the infrastructure for simple but innovative
    applications related to payments, incentives, investments, etc.


    Blockchains provide the infrastructure for projects to

    1. Create and use tokens as a store of value

    2. Validate and record transactions related to transferring of tokens or
    other state update logic

    3. Write simple programs, called smart contracts, to perform some logic and
    update the state of tokens.

    4. Smart contracts also have an account number (wallet address) associated
    with them, enabling smart contracts to receive and send money/tokens.
