    A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that stores the private and
    public keys of a user's cryptocurrency holdings. These keys are used to
    interact with the blockchain of a particular cryptocurrency and are
    necessary to access, send, or receive that cryptocurrency.


    When a user wants to send cryptocurrency to another user, they initiate a
    transaction on their wallet. The transaction is broadcast to the network and
    verified by network nodes. Once the transaction is verified, it is added to
    the blockchain, and the sender's balance is decreased, while the receiver's
    balance is increased.


    The private key stored in the wallet must be kept secure, as it allows
    access to the cryptocurrency held in the wallet. It is the user's
    responsibility to keep their private key safe, as there is no central
    authority that can recover a lost or stolen private key.


    There are several types of cryptocurrency wallets, including software
    wallets, hardware wallets, and paper wallets. Each type of wallet has its
    own advantages and disadvantages, and users should choose a wallet that
    suits their needs based on factors such as security, convenience, and
    accessibility.

    ### Custodian Wallets

    Custodian and non-custodian wallets are two types of cryptocurrency wallets
    that differ in the way they manage the private keys of users.


    Custodian wallets are cryptocurrency wallets where the private keys are
    managed by a third-party, usually a cryptocurrency exchange or financial
    services company. This means that the company has control over the user's
    funds and is responsible for securing them. Examples of custodian wallets
    include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.


    ### Non Custodian Wallets

    Non-custodian wallets are cryptocurrency wallets where the user holds their
    own private keys. This means that the user has full control over their funds
    and is responsible for securing their own private keys. Examples of
    non-custodian wallets include hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger, and
    software wallets like MyEtherWallet and MetaMask.


    The main difference between the two is control over the private keys and
    security. With a custodian wallet, the user is relying on the security
    measures put in place by the third-party to protect their funds, while with
    a non-custodian wallet, the user has full control and responsibility over
    the security of their funds.
