  details: >-
    Blockchain tokens are digital assets that are built on top of a blockchain
    platform. They are used as a unit of value and can be used to represent
    assets such as property, stocks, or even virtual items within a game or
    platform.


    The use of blockchain tokens offers several advantages over traditional
    forms of asset representation and transfer:


    1. Decentralization: Blockchain tokens are stored on a decentralized
    network, which means that they are not controlled by any single entity. This
    makes them more secure and resistant to tampering or censorship.

    2. Transparency: The transactions and transfers of blockchain tokens are
    publicly visible on the blockchain, creating a transparent and auditable
    record of all activity.

    3. Efficiency: The use of blockchain technology enables fast, secure and
    efficient transfers of tokens, without the need for intermediaries or
    middlemen.

    4. Programmability: Blockchain tokens can be programmed to include rules and
    logic, such as automatic transfer of tokens when certain conditions are met,
    making them more versatile and customizable.

    5. Accessibility: Blockchain tokens can be easily bought, sold and traded on
    various online exchanges, making them more accessible to a wider range of
    users.

    ERC-20 is a technical standard for Ethereum-based tokens. It defines a
    common set of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow, allowing developers to
    easily create and deploy new tokens on the Ethereum network.


    The ERC-20 standard defines a set of six functions that must be implemented
    by any Ethereum token that wants to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These
    functions include the methods for obtaining information about the token
    (such as its name, symbol, and total supply), as well as functions for
    transferring tokens between addresses.


    The ERC-20 standard has become widely adopted and is now used as the basis
    for many of the most popular Ethereum-based tokens, including stablecoins,
    security tokens, and utility tokens. This widespread adoption of the
    standard has led to a large and thriving ecosystem of Ethereum-based tokens,
    with many new tokens being created and traded on a daily basis.

  shortTitle: ERC-20 Use Cases
  details: >-
    ERC-20 tokens are used for a variety of purposes within the Ethereum
    ecosystem. Some of the most common uses for ERC-20 tokens include:


    1. Stablecoins: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to
    maintain a stable value, often pegged to a stable asset such as the US
    dollar. Many popular stablecoins, such as USDC and DAI, are built on the
    Ethereum network and are ERC-20 tokens.

    2. Security Tokens: Security tokens are tokens that represent ownership in
    an underlying asset, such as a company or real estate. They can be used to
    raise capital in a decentralized and secure manner and provide investors
    with a stake in the asset they represent.

    3. Utility Tokens: Utility tokens are used to access specific services or
    products within a decentralized application (dapp) built on the Ethereum
    network. The tokens give holders access to the services or products offered
    by the dapp.

    4. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications: ERC-20 tokens play a central
    role in the rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem, serving as the building blocks
    for many decentralized financial applications, such as lending and borrowing
    platforms, trading platforms, and more.

    5. Gaming: ERC-20 tokens can be used as virtual currency within
    decentralized games, providing a secure and decentralized way to trade and
    exchange virtual goods and items.
