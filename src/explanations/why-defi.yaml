    In the world of cryptocurrency, the phrase "don't trust, verify" is
    well-known. This concept does not exist in traditional finance because
    organizations do not provide access to all of their data, including
    transaction records, account numbers, active accounts, amount lent, and
    reserves. 


    However, in the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), this information is
    available on a public blockchain, allowing anyone to access and query the
    data to understand the current state of affairs. In fact, there are many
    DeFi projects that offer rewards to developers who can build user-friendly
    dashboards that provide insights into the system.


    Even during a period in 2022 when cryptocurrency prices plummeted by 95%,
    the top DeFi projects continued to behave as expected. In contrast,
    centralized crypto exchanges, similar to traditional banks, do not share
    data and do not offer insurance. Many centralized exchanges suffered
    financial losses and went bankrupt in 2022, while pure DeFi exchanges fared
    relatively well.
