    In the world of cryptocurrency, the phrase "don't trust, verify" is
    well-known. This concept does not exist in traditional finance because
    organizations do not provide access to all of their data, including
    transaction records, account numbers, active accounts, amount lent, and
    reserves. 


    However, in the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), this information is
    available on a public blockchain, allowing anyone to access and query the
    data to understand the current state of affairs. In fact, there are many
    DeFi projects that offer rewards to developers who can build user-friendly
    dashboards that provide insights into the system.


    Even during a period in 2022 when cryptocurrency prices plummeted by 95%,
    the top DeFi projects continued to behave as expected. In contrast,
    centralized crypto exchanges, similar to traditional banks, do not share
    data and do not offer insurance. Many centralized exchanges suffered
    financial losses and went bankrupt in 2022, while pure DeFi exchanges fared
    relatively well.

    projects.

    In the modern global world, our requirements from financial applications are
    quite advanced. We want to be able to transfer money to anyone around the
    world in seconds, we want to pay incrementally based on the task, or rules.
    Model day collaborations are also not straightforward. Like in a group of
    artists that post content on social media, we want to divide the payments
    based on number of views, quality, or category. Creating these types of
    applications are very hard in traditional finance.   


    DeFi is not just limited to purely finance. It enables the creation of
    communities that are backed by a common currency. The more business the
    community can create, the more it benefits each member of the community.
    There are many projects in crypto world that operate purely on 


    1. Nouns(https://nouns.wtf) -    The Nouns project is a distinctive
    undertaking that employs blockchain technology and was launched on August 8,
    2021. Nouns NFTs are pixelated representations of a person, place, or thing,
    and one new Noun is created and auctioned every 24 hours using a trustless
    system. The entire auction proceeds of each Noun are automatically
    transferred to the treasury.

      Every owner of a Noun becomes a member of the Nouns DAO and is entitled to one vote in all matters of governance. Noun votes are non-transferable, but can be delegated to another individual as long as the owner still possesses the Noun. Nouns exclusively control the treasury through governance. The group of ten builders who initiated the project are called 'Nounders' and will receive rewards in the form of Nouns, which amounts to 10% of the supply for the first 5 years.


    2. Constitution DAO - Constitution DAO, a decentralized autonomous
    organization, raised nearly $47 million in Ether within five days through a
    social media crowdfunding campaign in mid-November 2021. The group's goal
    was to use the funds to purchase a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution at a
    Sotheby's auction and donate it to a non-profit run by DAO donors. Although
    they were unsuccessful in their bid, their efforts demonstrated the
    influence of decentralized finance-powered communities. The incident also
    highlighted an interesting historical parallel of ordinary individuals
    uniting to challenge a conventional establishment.
