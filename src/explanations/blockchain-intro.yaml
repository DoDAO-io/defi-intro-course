    Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records
    transactions across a network of computers. Transactions are verified and
    recorded through cryptography, making it nearly impossible for any one user
    to alter the record retroactively without being detected by the network. The
    result is a system that is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship,
    and one that allows multiple parties to have a shared and consistent view of
    a database without requiring a central authority. This makes it particularly
    useful for applications such as cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, and
    other applications that require a secure and transparent way of tracking
    transactions.

    A blockchain ledger works by maintaining a growing list of records, called
    blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains
    a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
    data. This creates a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."


    When a new transaction is initiated, it is broadcast to the network of nodes
    (computers) that maintain the ledger. These nodes then validate the
    transaction using algorithms built into the blockchain protocol, such as
    checking that the sender has enough funds to complete the transaction. Once
    validated, the transaction is added to a block and the block is added to the
    blockchain.


    Each node in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain, and all nodes
    must reach consensus on the state of the ledger before any new block can be
    added. This ensures that the ledger is consistent and tamper-proof, as any
    attempt to alter a block would require a majority of nodes to agree to the
    change, which is highly unlikely.


    The decentralized and secure nature of the blockchain ledger makes it ideal
    for a wide range of applications, including secure record keeping, smart
    contracts, and digital currencies.

- key: hashing
  shortTitle: Hashing
  details: >-
    Hashing is an essential concept in blockchain technology and plays a crucial
    role in maintaining its security and integrity.


    A hash is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "message") and
    returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a "digest"
    that is unique to the unique values of the input. In the context of
    blockchain, hashes are used to represent the data stored in a block, such as
    transaction data.


    When a new block is added to the blockchain, the hash of the block is
    calculated using the hash function. The hash of the previous block is also
    included in the calculation of the new block's hash. This creates a chain of
    blocks, each with a unique hash, and a reference to the previous block's
    hash. As a result, any change to the data in a block will result in a
    different hash for that block, which would be easily detected.


    This is why hashes are important in blockchain technology. They ensure that
    once a block has been added to the blockchain, its data cannot be altered
    without also changing the hashes of all subsequent blocks, which would be
    noticed by the network and rejected.


    In summary, hashing is a key component of blockchain technology that helps
    to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the blockchain by
    creating a chain of hashes that reference each other and can detect any
    changes to the data.
