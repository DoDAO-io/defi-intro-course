    Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records
    transactions across a network of computers. Transactions are verified and
    recorded through cryptography, making it nearly impossible for any one user
    to alter the record retroactively without being detected by the network. The
    result is a system that is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship,
    and one that allows multiple parties to have a shared and consistent view of
    a database without requiring a central authority. This makes it particularly
    useful for applications such as cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, and
    other applications that require a secure and transparent way of tracking
    transactions.
