  Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new movement in the world of finance
  that aims to build decentralized financial applications using blockchain
  technology. The main idea behind DeFi is to bring financial services to people
  who are underbanked or unbanked, and to provide transparent, secure and
  accessible financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries
  such as banks. This can include lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins,
  decentralized exchanges, and more. The goal of DeFi is to provide financial
  services that are open to everyone, regardless of geography or personal
  circumstances, and that are not controlled by any single entity.
