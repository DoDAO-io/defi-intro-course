  Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new movement in the world of finance
  that aims to build decentralized financial applications using blockchain
  technology. The main idea behind DeFi is to bring financial services to people
  who are underbanked or unbanked, and to provide transparent, secure and
  accessible financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries
  such as banks. This can include lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins,
  decentralized exchanges, and more. The goal of DeFi is to provide financial
  services that are open to everyone, regardless of geography or personal
  circumstances, and that are not controlled by any single entity.

      Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions
      across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data. The decentralized nature of the technology ensures that no single
      party has control over the data and makes it resistant to tampering and
      revision, making it a secure way of storing and transmitting information.
      This technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but
      has potential applications in a variety of industries, including finance,
      supply chain management, and voting systems.

      Blockchain tokens are digital assets that are built on top of a blockchain
      platform. They are used as a unit of value and can be used to represent

      platform.
