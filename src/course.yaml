  Asset tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset, such as
  real estate or art, into a digital token on a blockchain. This token can then
  be bought, sold, and traded on a blockchain-based marketplace, similar to how
  stocks are traded on a stock exchange. By tokenizing assets, it allows for
  fractional ownership and increased liquidity, as well as enabling new
  investment opportunities for investors.
