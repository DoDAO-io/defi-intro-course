  Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new movement in the world of finance
  that aims to build decentralized financial applications using blockchain
  technology. The main idea behind DeFi is to bring financial services to people
  who are underbanked or unbanked, and to provide transparent, secure and
  accessible financial services without relying on traditional intermediaries
  such as banks. This can include lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins,
  decentralized exchanges, and more. The goal of DeFi is to provide financial
  services that are open to everyone, regardless of geography or personal
  circumstances, and that are not controlled by any single entity.

      Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions
      across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data. The decentralized nature of the technology ensures that no single
      party has control over the data and makes it resistant to tampering and
      revision, making it a secure way of storing and transmitting information.
      This technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but
      has potential applications in a variety of industries, including finance,
      supply chain management, and voting systems.

    title: Tokens
    details: >+
      Blockchain tokens are digital assets that are built on top of a blockchain
      platform. They are used as a unit of value and can be used to represent
      assets such as property, stocks, or even virtual items within a game or
      platform.

    title: Wallets
    details: >-
      A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that enables users to securely
      store, manage, and transfer digital assets using blockchain technology.
      The assets can include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
      others.


      The wallet stores the user's private keys, which are used to sign
      transactions and provide access to the assets stored in the wallet. The
      private keys are stored on the user's device and are encrypted to ensure
      their security.


      A blockchain wallet allows users to send and receive assets, view their
      transaction history, and manage multiple assets within a single platform.
      The transactions on the blockchain are recorded on a public ledger, making
      it transparent and secure, and reducing the risk of fraud and hacking.

    title: TradFi vs CeFi vs DeFi
    details: >
      - TradFi - TradFi stands for "Traditional Finance", which refers to the
      traditional financial services and institutions, such as banks, insurance
      companies, and investment firms, that have been around for many decades. 

      - CeFi - Centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the cryptocurrency world operate
      on the premise that all crypto trading transactions are managed and
      executed through a central platform in the realm of centralized finance.
      Notable examples of centralized finance companies include Binance,
      Coinbase, and Kraken.

      - DeFi - DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, refers to financial
      applications that operate without the need for intermediaries like banks
      and brokerages. These applications are powered by smart contracts, which
      are computer codes that automatically execute based on predefined
      conditions.
